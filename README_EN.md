# NoNodePhysics

[Chinese](README.md)

Implements physics functionality bypassing the node tree via a global singleton, aiming to optimize performance.

## GlobalAreaManager

A global Area manager. Areas created by this manager can not only collide normally with other areas generated by the same manager, but also collide with external `Area2D` nodes.

Regarding "collision with external `Area2D` nodes":
- On one hand, the area can correctly detect external `Area2D` nodes and trigger their signals.
- On the other hand, `Area2D` nodes can also detect the area, but will only accurately emit **shape-level** signals.

Current Area implementation:
- Basic detection functionality is implemented.
- The signal system is not yet fully equivalent to that of `Area2D`.
- Features such as gravity settings from `Area2D` are not directly supported, but can be achieved via `area-rid` combined with low-level services (i.e., not currently encapsulated).
- Currently, an area supports only one shape.

Future plans:
- Behavior will become more consistent with `Area2D` nodes.
- Methods will be provided to convert between `Area2D` nodes and `AreaInstance`/`AreaData`.

## TODO
- Global Query Manager
  - Goal: Replace `RayCast2D` and `ShapeCast2D`
- Global Physics Entity Manager
  - Postponed due to higher complexity
