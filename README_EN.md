# NoNodePhysics

[Chinese](README.md)

Implements physics functionality bypassing the node tree via a global singleton to optimize performance.

## Godot Versions

Abstract classes are used in versions 4.5 and above.

## GlobalAreaManager

A global Area manager. The QuickArea created by this manager can collide both with other Areas generated by the same manager and with external Area2D nodes.

Its core functionality is collision detection. For performance reasons, some features of Area2D nodes are not implemented:
- These include: damping, gravity mode, priority, etc. However, corresponding set methods are provided.

### QuickArea

Current implementation of QuickArea:
- Focuses on core functionalities like collision detection and signal emission, with no emphasis on setting properties such as gravity or damping.
- The signal system focuses on overall Area entry and exit events, with no shape-level signals.
- Currently, an area supports only one shape.

### Manager

- The QuickAreas created by it are not attached to nodes, so they will only trigger shape-level signals of Area2D nodes.

## TODO
- Global Query Manager
  - Goal: Replace RayCast2D and ShapeCast2D.
- Global Physics Entity Manager
  - More complex; implementation is postponed.

## Known Issues
- When the number of collisions is high, the Godot editor debugger may fail.
